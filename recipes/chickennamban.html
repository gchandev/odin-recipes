    <h3>Chicken Namban Recipe</h3>
    <p>Chicken Nanban is deep-fried chicken with tartar sauce, a dish from Miyazaki prefecture in Kyusyu, the southern big island of Japan.  The chicken is lightly battered and fried, then dipped in sweet and sour sauce just like Nanbanzuke, marinaded fried fish with vegetables.  The fried chicken can be eaten just by itself, but topping with tartar sauce makes it Chicken Nanban.  It may not sound like the healthiest Japanese food, but it is a popular kind of lunch dish for many at shops and cafeterias in business areas.</p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp flour</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>deep-frying oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Tartar Sauce</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 boiled egg, chopped</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp pickles (cornichons), finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Japanese mayonnaise</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make tartar sauce in advance. Mix all the tartar sauce ingredients in a bowl. Set aside in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>In a small pot, heat soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sugar together until the sugar has completely dissolved, forming a vinegar sauce. Pour out in a shallow dish (large enough for dipping the chicken later). Set the vinegar sauce aside.</li>
        <li>Butterfly chicken breasts, and pound with a meat mallet to flatten and thin to about 1/2" (1 cm). Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Coat chicken with flour, then dip in beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Heat deep-frying oil to 350 F (180 C). Fry chicken until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Dip fried chicken immediately in the vinegar sauce, to cover both sides. Cut chicken into bite size pieces or slices. Serve with the tartar sauce.</li>
    </ol>
